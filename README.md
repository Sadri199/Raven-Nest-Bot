# Welcome to Raven's Nest Board Mission bot

This is a passion project. I will never make money based on this project, nor i intend to make money based on this project.

This bot was made to post pictures in Twitter and Bluesky based on the missions from "Armored Core". 

## Explanation

What this bot does is basically, generate characters and locations, make a mission based on some flavor text, then print all this data in 4 different pictures and finally upload this pictures to Twitter and Bluesky.

## Version 2.0

So, this new update changes the fourth template for a new picture, in this one there are 3 blocks where in each one a character or location can appear. Thus mimicking more the mission briefings in Armored Core.

## Forks

For now i will not make this repo public, but after it's done, if you want you can fork it, but let me know before hand.

## Credits

- The images used as templates are from Armored Core 1, so credits to FromSoftware. 
- Font used is "Perfect DOS VGA 437 Win", i get it from [Here](https://www.ffonts.net/Perfect-DOS-VGA-437.font?text=You+are+to+eliminate+illegal). I think the owner of this font is [Zeh Fernando](https://portfolio.zehfernando.com/). If i'm wrong, let me know.
- All characters mentioned in this pictures correspond to their respective creators, i'm just using their names and their photos. If someone wants to take out a character, let me know.
- At a code level, anything that isn't a module was done by me.
